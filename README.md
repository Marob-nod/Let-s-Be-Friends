# The Concept

Based on the fact that there are both applications for making friends and practicing languages, we decided to build a new application that combines both. With "Let's be Friends", we can join or organize events in our community or in a new city while learning a new language.
With a team of 3 back-end and 2 front-end developpers, we created the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of our project and we will be glad to show it to you !
